    "text": "During your master you will approach biology from a quantitative point of view.\nSome aspects of biological sciences has been quantitative since their start. Genetics for example is been quantitative since the beginning; when Gregor Mendel discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance, combining experimental work with statistiscal testing.\nSo, chances are that you are not completely new to the quantitative approach. For those who start from zero instead, don’t worry, it’s fun."

Open a terminal and type python or python3 to open it.\n\n\n4.2.3 In a Docker Container\nI personally use this option. It requires you to install both the IDE Visual Studio Code and the virtualization platform Docker.\nIn this way you will run python in a container isolated from your main operating system through Docker and you will connect to it using visual studio code.\nThis setup is done through a Dev Container It’s easier than it sounds, find an example in this page with video.\nTo try this setup:\n\nInstall Docker.\nInstall Visual Studio Code.\nInstall the Remote Container extension to Visual Studio Code.\nDownload this Github Repo and open it with Visual Studio Code."
